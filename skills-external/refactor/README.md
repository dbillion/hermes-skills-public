# Code Refactoring Skill

A stable refactoring skill for **any AI coding agent**. Safe, incremental, behavior-preserving code improvements for any programming language.

Works with Claude Code, Cursor, Aider, Continue, GitHub Copilot, OpenAI Assistants, or any LLM that accepts a system prompt.

Built on Martin Fowler's refactoring catalog, extended with modern patterns for functional programming, async/await, reactive systems, dependency injection, and architectural patterns (MVVM, MVP, Clean Architecture, Hexagonal, Repository, Use Case).

---

## What It Does

- **Detects code smells** across 6 families (Bloat, OO Abusers, Change Preventers, Dispensables, Couplers, Architectural Violations)
- **Applies 70+ refactoring operations** from the complete Fowler catalog + modern patterns + architectural patterns
- **Handles architectural refactoring** — safely migrates toward MVVM, MVP, Clean Architecture, Repository pattern, and more
- **Works in any language** — TypeScript, Python, Go, Rust, Java, Kotlin, C#, Swift, Ruby, C/C++, SQL, and more
- **Tests gate every step** — runs your test suite after each change; reverts immediately on failure
- **One operation at a time** — no bundled changes, every step is independently verifiable
- **Safety-first** — explicit red lines for public APIs, serialization formats, concurrent code, and architectural layer violations

### Manual install (any agent)

Copy [`PROMPT.md`](PROMPT.md) into your agent's system prompt, custom instructions, or rules file. That's the complete self-contained skill — no other files needed.

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MuhiminOsim/code-refactoring-skill/main/PROMPT.md
```

For a generic global install:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.agents/skills/refactor
curl -o ~/.agents/skills/refactor/PROMPT.md \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MuhiminOsim/code-refactoring-skill/main/PROMPT.md
```

### Claude Code (git install)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MuhiminOsim/code-refactoring-skill \
  ~/.claude/skills/refactor
```

The skill auto-activates — no configuration needed.

## Usage

Trigger the skill by asking Claude Code to refactor, with any of these phrases:

| Trigger phrase | What happens |
|---|---|
| "refactor this" / "clean this up" | Detects smells, presents ranked findings, confirms before acting |
| "extract this into a function" | Goes directly to execution |
| "rename X to Y" | Renames with full call-site mapping via grep |
| "simplify these conditionals" | Applies guard clauses, consolidation, or polymorphism |
| "this function is too long" | Diagnoses, extracts methods, verifies tests |
| "remove this duplication" | Identifies shared logic, extracts and consolidates |
| "modernize this" | Applies async/await, pipelines, value types, DI patterns |
| "my controller is too fat" | Maps architecture, diagnoses Fat Controller smell, extracts Use Case or Presenter |
| "I want MVVM" / "I want MVP" | Maps current architecture, confirms target pattern, migrates layer by layer |
| "view has business logic" | Detects UI with Business Logic smell, extracts ViewModel or Presenter |
| "introduce a repository" | Maps data access, introduces Repository interface, migrates callers one file at a time |
| "separation of concerns" / "layer violation" | Maps layers, identifies violations, fixes with correct abstraction |

### Example session

```
You: This function is too long, clean it up

Claude: Reading processOrder() at orders.ts:45 (142 lines)...

Detected smells (ranked):
1. [Blocker] Long Method — processOrder() is 142 lines with 4 internal sections
2. [Major] Duplicate Code — discount logic at lines 67–89 also appears in cart.ts:23
3. [Minor] Primitive Obsession — price passed as raw float

Plan:
1. Extract calculateDiscount() from lines 67–89
2. Extract applyTaxes() from lines 91–110
3. Extract formatOrderSummary() from lines 112–130
Confirm? (tests will run after each step)

You: Yes, go

Claude: Step 1: Performing Extract Method — calculateDiscount()

BEFORE: [lines 67–89 inline in processOrder()]
AFTER:  [new calculateDiscount(user, price) function]

Running tests... npm test ✓ (all 47 tests pass)
Step 1 complete.

Step 2: Performing Extract Method — applyTaxes()
...
```

## How It Works

The skill follows a strict 5-phase process for every refactoring request:

```
Phase 1: Intake      → Read all target files, detect language, find test harness
Phase 2: Diagnose    → Detect and rank code smells
Phase 3: Plan        → Decompose into atomic, verifiable steps
Phase 4: Execute     → Apply one change at a time, run tests after each
Phase 5: Wrap-up     → Summarize changes, suggest (not apply) follow-ons
```

## Safety Model

The skill has three tiers of safety enforcement:

### Red Lines (stop and ask before ANY change)
- Public API changes (exported symbols, function signatures, module paths)
- Serialization format changes (JSON keys, database columns, proto fields)
- Concurrency behavior changes (lock ordering, async boundaries)
- Error contract changes (types thrown, messages matched by callers)
- Files with no test coverage
- Files with recent concurrent edits
- Moving code with side effects (emails, payments, queues) between layers
- Introducing a new architectural layer where none existed
- Moving code that participates in a transaction boundary
- **Agentic Hallucinations**: Guessing file paths, symbol names, or test failures instead of verifying via active tool executions.

### Yellow Lines (warn, require confirmation)
- Renaming a symbol with >20 call sites
- Splitting a class used in >5 modules
- Changing parameter order with >10 callers
- Inlining a function present in multiple files

### Rollback Protocol
On any test failure after an edit:
1. Revert the edit immediately
2. State exactly which test failed and with which error
3. Diagnose root cause
4. Propose a safer decomposition

**The skill never fixes forward.** A refactoring that breaks a test is reverted, diagnosed, and re-approached safely.

### Architectural Safety (§8)

Architectural refactoring gets its own stricter protocol:
- **Map first:** Current architecture is mapped (layers + violations) before any file is touched
- **Confirm target:** User must confirm the target pattern before step 1
- **The Moving Invariant:** Never change logic AND location in the same step. Every move follows: Introduce → Redirect → Remove, with tests passing after each sub-step
- **High confidence required:** Medium confidence is not sufficient for architectural changes — blast radius is too large

## Code Smell Detection

Before applying any operation (when no specific operation is requested), the skill diagnoses:

| Family | Examples |
|---|---|
| **Bloat** | Long Method, Large Class, Long Parameter List, Data Clumps, Primitive Obsession |
| **OO Abusers** | Switch on Type, Temporary Field, Refused Bequest, Alternative Classes |
| **Change Preventers** | Divergent Change, Shotgun Surgery, Parallel Inheritance Hierarchies |
| **Dispensables** | Duplicate Code, Dead Code, Lazy Class, Speculative Generality |
| **Couplers** | Feature Envy, Inappropriate Intimacy, Message Chains, Middle Man |
| **Architectural Violations** | Fat Controller, UI with Business Logic, Anemic Domain Model, Layer Violation, Scattered Data Access, Missing Domain Layer |

## Design Principles

**Why one operation at a time?**  
Bundling changes makes failures hard to diagnose and reverts destructive. Each atomic step can be verified independently, and any failure has a clear, minimal cause.

**Why smell detection before acting?**  
Jumping straight to a requested operation can optimize the wrong thing. Smells are diagnosed first so the most impactful change is done first — not the first one mentioned.

**Why separate catalog files?**  
A single 60-operation reference would consume too much context. The decision tree in `SKILL.md` routes to exactly the catalog file needed — a composing refactoring never loads inheritance knowledge.

**Why token-sparing and lazy loading?**  
AI agents suffer from context fatigue and cost overhead in long sessions. The skill specifies a lazy-loading rule: agents locate sections via targeted searches (`grep_search`) first and load only specific line-ranges (e.g., lines 40–100) using restricted view tools rather than reading whole reference guides.

**Why is safety.md standalone?**  
Safety protocols must be read in full and are not operation-specific. Scattering stop conditions across catalog files creates inconsistent behavior. A dedicated file makes the red lines impossible to miss.

**Why does architectural refactoring need its own protocol?**  
Code-level refactoring touches 1–3 files and has a small blast radius. Architectural refactoring is multi-file by definition, moves logic across layer boundaries, and can produce behavioral differences even when the code looks identical (transaction scope changes, side-effect timing changes, dependency direction reversal). The Moving Invariant — never change logic AND location in the same step — is what makes this safe. The Introduce → Redirect → Remove sequence ensures tests validate behavior at every sub-step.
